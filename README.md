## General info
In these unprecedented times information systems are essential and that is why Uni-QUICK has been designed to incorporate efficiently the most relevant topics - classified in more than 10 different categories, in only one site, to facilitate its management; helping thus users find effective answers to their queries to mitigate as much as possible the transition process to a different country especially in a period of crisis or change. Thus, remote education guidelines and information about new university-facilities are for instance perfectly managed from the virtual assistant and instantly updated in all its different categories and sub-categories when required. Information about quarantine - for the moment still valid for international students coming to the UK, information about flexible new enrolment dates due to Covid-19 and all the latest updates regarding health and wellbeing in general for prospective and current students, can be easily incorporated and efficiently provided by Uni-QUICK.

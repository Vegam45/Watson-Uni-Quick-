## General info
In these challenging times information systems are essential and that is why Uni-QUICK! has been designed to incorporate efficiently the most relevant topics - classified in more than 10 different categories, everything in only one site!. The virtual modality is perfect to avoid other inefficient student-facing services, helping users find effective answers to their queries in a safer manner and mitigate as much as possible the transition process to a different country for international students - especially in a period of crisis or change. Thus, remote education guidelines and information about new university-facilities are for instance perfectly managed from the virtual assistant and instantly updated in all its different categories and sub-categories when required. Information about quarantine - for the moment still valid for international students coming to the UK, information about flexible new enrolment dates due to Covid-19 and all the latest updates regarding health and wellbeing in general, for prospective and current students, can be easily incorporated and efficiently provided by Uni-QUICK!. 

A sample of custom intents topics: 
* Visa types: Tier 4, Short-term, Child student visa 
* Healthcare NHS, IHS
* Student Accommodation Management: On-campus and external, reservation system
* Bank Accounts UK: Documents required for international students comig to the UK
* Student Jobs: Internships, Part-time, Full-time (prospective international, home and current students)
* Covid-19 information sample for prospective, current students, University Staff members: new enrollment dates, new rules on campus, quarantine for international students, others. 

## My First Assistant Check list 

* Complex dialog
* Custom Intents Definition
* Dialog nodes to handle intents
* Entities to make responses more specific
* Pattern entity - Dialog incorporation to find patterns in user inputs
* Context variables 
* Slots 

** Improve the dialog!: review complexity, add intents, identify new relevant topics EDIT/TEST/DEMO

## Next Steps
To successfully mitigate difficulties associated to language barriers, Uni-QUICK will incorporate other Watson features such as speech to text and translation services as a part of the solution.

* Speech to text and translation services to improve customer satisfaction
* Creation of new intents in the context of Covid-19 social distancing UK
  Categpory 1: Restaurants and coffees / Sub-category 1: Discount and coupons for students   
  Category 2: Social Life on Campus and external, Transportation Information (University location)
* Watson working on: Platform, website, App
* Start-up project linked to Watson AI and KM case study - in development 
* Opportunities at IBM! Graduate Scheme:))
